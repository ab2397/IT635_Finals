# IT635_Finals
Here is my Finals Deliverable: I have an init.js file that creates a MongoDB database called **CompanyX**. The database includes three collections: "emp_addresses" (includes the addresses of every employee in the company), "employees" (contain the names of the employees), and "offices" (contains the work space that each employee operates in). **emp_addresses** contains a validator, in which all of its properties are verify to be present in the data insertion. The other two collection are simply made with a db.createCollection statement with no properties or data specified.
